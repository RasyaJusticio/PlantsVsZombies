# Plants Vs Zombies
A Plants Vs Zombies clone developed using Javascript's Canvas.

## How to run
1. Download the zip
2. Extract it and open in Visual Studio Code
3. Install [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension and open index.html with live server.

I only now realizes that this project can only be ran using this extension. I will fix this on future updates.
